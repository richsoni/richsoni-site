Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
So, I took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright</p>
<p>Well he had her stick out her tongue and listened to her breathe<br>
He felt her pulse beat, while he looked at the watch below his sleeve<br>
Then I said tell me great doctor, are there any issues you perceive</p>
<p>He said the hound she is a healthy flower<br>
Theres not an issue I can see<br>
don't forget to pay the front counter<br>
Two hundred forty five dollars and 88 cents before you leave<br>
So I left a little lighter, but no smarter wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p>Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
So, I took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright</p>
<p>But, the doctor was useless, and he charged me an arm and a leg<br>
So, I tried my luck with a dog gypsy, to see if she would be the one to peg<br>
Down the cause if this issue, find my hounds easter egg</p>
<p>She put her hand on the hounds ears, and looked both their black eyes met<br>
She saw into my hounds soul, but when she looked back at me began to fret<br>
She seems happy as a clam my friend, before you leave pay off your debt</p>
<p>One hundred fifty two dollars and fifty cents!!!</p>
<p>Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
So, I took her to the doctor, and a pet gypsy to make sure everything is alright</p>
<p>On the bus ride home, a met a witch doctor and the two of us started to chat<br>
He charged me 25 dollars to brew a tea within his hat<br>
He said she clearly has a sore throat, and this is the cure for that</p>
<p>...it goes without saying that it didn't work</p>
<p>Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
So, I took her to the doctor, a pet gypsy, and a witch doctor see if everything is alright</p>
<p>When the witch doctor left, a men in a orange sari came and sat down<br>
He had a face that looked exotic, and not a single hair upon his crown<br>
He said my desperate friend I know why you dog aint makin' a sound</p>
<p>She took a vow of silence, to live the Buddhist way<br>
She watches life pass by and looks out the window each and everyday<br>
She wants you to give all your money to the Buddhist monetary</p>
<p>Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life<br>
It took a doctor, pet gypsy, witch doctor, and a monk to why she aint alright</p>
<p>I gave into the monk and donated my money, and now we both live life without a strife</p>
