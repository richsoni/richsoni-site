Notes:
  - Quality from new mixer is amazing.  Just knowing how to use it really well helps a lot.  Especially for getting a recording.
  - Really digging my new songs.  magellan-and-me is the only one that needs to be reworked (Think dylan acoustic 1966, and how he rearranged all the songs).
  - Was very loose with the setlist.  Played all the new songs at once.  Played very little covers
  - Hard Rain is really good.  Keeper
  - Did not break any strings
