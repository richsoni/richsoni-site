the strength of a culture is the only thing we can truly rely on ~ p. 130</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Circle of Safety</em> is a group within a team which we both confide in and protect.\nA shallow Circle of Safety is an indicator of a toxic team culture and poor leadership.\nSmall circles, expose the company to internal competition and threats.\nWidening the circle removes the team\'s focus on internal threats, so they can concentrate on achieving goals.\nAs such, leaders should strive to widen Circles of Safety within their teams.</p>\n<p>In\n<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGZKQM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DGZKQM8&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20">Leaders Eat Last</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DGZKQM8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />,\nSinek suggests several ways to widen the Circle of Safety.\nOne suggestion is to focus on relationships instead of numbers.\nBy doing this leaders assure team members that they are not going to relinquish them for short term financial gains.\nExpanding the circle makes the team a differentiating asset against competition.</p>\n<h1>Protect The Pack</h1>\n<blockquote style=\'clear:none\'>Managers must become leaders in their own right, which means they must take responsibility for the care and protection of those in their charge ~ p. 115</blockquote>\n<p>Leaders build trust with a team by holding up a shield and protecting them from both internal and external threats.\nThe leader needs to defend from external treats like recession, competition, and regulation enclosing the circle.\nLeaders also need to prevent internal threats from poisoning the team culture by eliminating toxic behavior.</p>\n<p>Leaders need to earn the respect of followers.\nIf the leader is weak, followers will not respect their authority.\nFollowers want to be lead by a great leader.\nWhen following a great leader, the team can band together and accomplish great things.</p>\n<h1>Trust The Team</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We work to advance the vision of a leader who inspires us and we work to undermine a dictator who means to control us ~ p. 139</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mutual trust is a requirement for all members within a Circle of Safety.\nWhen excluded from the circle, team members are forced to fend for themselves.\nThey must fight to secure their own position, even if it compromises the team\'s integrity or its goals.\nConversely, when teammates are not in competition they can band together, and work on achieving bigger goals.</p>\n<p>An important part of leadership is having faith in the team to do a great job.\nAll members need to be appreciated and acknowledged for their contribution to the teams goals.\nActions like scaremongering and micromanaging blockade members from obtaining the trust of their leader.\nWhen leaders trust their team, they are inviting them to contribute to something bigger than themselves.\nThis makes everyone feel good, and inspires the whole team to do great things.</p>\n<p>True leaders enable the team to thrive, and allow them to accomplish something greater than any one person could alone.</p>\n<h1>Leader is Not A Rank</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rank of office is not what makes someone a leader. Leadership is the choice to serve others with or without any formal rank ~ p. 66</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To gain the teams trust a leader must fulfill certain expectations.\nOne such expectation is the leader will put their own interests behind those of the team ( e.g. eat last ).</p>\n<p>A leader is the team member that inspires the rest of the team to achieve its goals.\nA leader can reside in any section of a teams hierarchy.\nManagers are not always the leader of a team.\nLikewise, leaders are not always in management positions.</p>\n<p>The followers choose the leader.\nA rank or position does not dictate who a leader is.\nIt is the level of belief the followers have in the leader to provide leadership to the team that chooses the leader.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGZKQM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DGZKQM8&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20">Leaders Eat Last</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DGZKQM8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />\nis a great read.\nThis article is just a small taste of the kinds of information Simon Sinek explores within the book.</p>\n<p>I downloaded the book on audible, and plowed through it.\nAdditionally, I purchased the\n<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGZKQM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DGZKQM8&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20">ebook from amazon</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DGZKQM8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />\nso I could re-read / highlight all the good parts.</p>\n<p>If you read the book, make sure to contribute to the discussion in the comments section below.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Simon Sinek Reveals Why Some Teams Pull Together Better Than Others In His Latest Book 'Leaders Eat Last'"},fields:{date:"2014-04-17"}}},pathContext:{url:"/posts/2014-04-17-leaders-eat-last/"}}}});
