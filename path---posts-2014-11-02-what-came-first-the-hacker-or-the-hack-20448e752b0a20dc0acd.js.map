I think so. Is he therefore a hacker? That depends on how much he likes to hack.\\\" ~ Richard Stallman</blockquote>\\n<p>Why did Stallman attempt to <a href=\\\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\\\">use 6 chopsticks at the same time</a>?\\nAccording to him: <em>'because using three in one hand is hard and ordinarily never thought of, it has \\\"hack value\\\"'</em>.\\nBut, only a hacker would find 'hack value' in that.\\nNon-hackers would most likely not find merit in attempting it.\\nA key ingredient of hacking is an equal pleasure in both the process and the results.\\nDue to this, a hacker will dig up value in activities others see no advantage.</p>\\n<p>Stallman says, a hacker then is quantified by how much they like to hack (how strong that passion is).\\nThat means one has to hack before becoming a hacker.\\nHowever, certain hacks will only be attractive to hackers.\\nA novice hacker may not find hack-value in activities experts find value in.\\nThis leaves us with an interesting catch-22.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps the answer is that hacker is a relative term.\\nOne becomes a hacker when they meet all of the criteria, but it does not mean that they cannot hack.\\nCertain hacks require a hacker, but others may have more 'hack-value' to a non-hacker.\\nIn that sense, the hack comes first, but only very briefly.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<ol>\\n<li><s>What qualities define a hacker?</s></li>\\n<li><s>How are hackers related to hacks?</s></li>\\n<li><s>How do hackers become hackers?</s></li>\\n<li><s>What comes first, a hacker, or a hack?</s></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>These questions bring forth insights into hackers and their relationships to hacks.\\nFor aspiring hackers, these can be checkpoints to strive for.\\nThey expose that one should focus on more than hacks if they want to become a hacker.\\nMy advise for aspiring hackers is fake it until you make it.\\nKeep hacking!!!</p>\\n<p>For hackers, understand that you cannot be a hacker in every domain.\\nTo become a hacker you have to curate the 3 features a hacker has for that activity.</p>\\n<h1>Resources</h1>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\\\">On Hacking by Richard
