# Takeaways

In this book Rolf Potts inspires the reader to change the way they think about travel.  
He bashes both the supercilious long term traveler, and the shallow tourist claiming that both do not do travel justice.  
Instead, he offers advice for experiencing places to their fullest as you embark on your journeys.  

There are many lessons to be learned from Potts, and indeed a mindset change occurs after reading the book.  

Some of the things I have taken away are:  

  1. *Take time to acclimate to you travel destination.*  I have been thinking this may involve 'working from home' at that location for a few days before actually 'vacationing' due to my vacation day restriction at work.
    This will help ease you into a vacation mindset, and help strip you of your hustle and bustle attitude that is neccisary to survive in our culture.
  1. *Get to know both the locals, and other travellers.* After all the sights are only a superficial part of the trip that wear off after time.  To take the most value home you should interact with people from cultures besides your own.
    I find this lesson to apply well to every day life as well.  Maybe instead of listening to music on the train, I could take time to learn about those sitting next to me every once and a while.
  1. *The tourist destinations have value.*  Often people, like myself, shun the idea of visiting tourist destinations.  Indeed they are overloaded with kids crying, people smelling, photo bombing, long bathroom lines, and overpriced food and beverages.  However, they are so popular for a reason, and there is a lot of culture to be absorbed through the chaos.

These are just a few of the tips I took away from the book.  He also offers more practical advise for dealing with other cultures which is just as useful.  Including:

  1.  How to deal with money and haggling
  1.  Where to stay, and how to travel
  1.  Tips for dealing with cultural differences ( especially for dealing with women in countries where they unfortunately have less rights than our own residence)

If you are thinking to yourself, 'This sounds like a bunch of hippie bullshit', well, it kind of is.  
However it is not a bad idea to adopt a bit of a hippie mindset while traveling.  
After all, hippies are generally at peace, happy, and open minded, which is usually what travelling is all about.
