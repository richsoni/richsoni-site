Studying the character of Howard Roarke from The Fountainhead made me have a very settling realization.
It probably can be attributed to also really agreeing with this Bob Dylan quote: tkl (san fran the one about the music is most important).

*I write and record for myself*.

For a few weeks I felt like I had no purpose or goal.
Which is strange because I just released a great album.
I am busy promoting and selling it.
I perform weekly.

Yet, something was missing.
It was writing/recording songs.
Took me a while to figure it out.
That is my architecture.
Hearing a song in my head and turning it into a recording.

I love the frustration.  
I love staying up late, and being tired during the day because I was up all night.  
I love the sense of completion when its done.  

Bob Dylan is a great example of this because he has released tk albums in tk years.
In tk he released 3 albums: Blonde On Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited, and Bringing It All Back Home.
Even when he was home in Saugrettestk, NY he was recording the basement tapes.

The Basements are a great example because he was not doing it for anyone else.
Its what he loves to do: *write and record music*.
