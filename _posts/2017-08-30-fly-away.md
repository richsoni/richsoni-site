When I wrote Fly Away, I had a very specific performance in mind.
It was the 2016 Jersey Shore Festival in Seaside Heights, NJ.
It was really exciting to book some shows at that festival for a few reasons.

For starters, I spent a lot of time on the Barrier Island throughout the years.
When I was a teenager, my parents bought a house a few miles away from the island and we would stay there on weekends over the summer.
I had lots of adventures, and did a lot of recharging down there over the years.
In fact, this is being written from there right now.

There is something unique about the area.
Its nothing especially magical, but something unique about it.
Something you would only pick up on if you spent more than a week or two there.
Its something that definitely comes out in my songwriting.
Sometimes in an obvious and genuine way like in Together, Lets Get Deserted, or Little Seaside Home.
Other times its something less tangible, like playing Since the Last Blood Moon to the beat of the crickets on the houses back porch.
That gave me the idea for the crickets that guide the sound of Heartbeat Road.

Its that streak of character that got me excited to play a show down there.
I was set to play in a place called Riggers.
It was a local bar that I knew, and I knew the clientele and myself would share an affinity for the area.
It was exactly the crowd I like to play to: Salty Sailors, Irish Firemen, Salt Water Taffy Slingers, Off Shift Waitresses.
The sand of the beach.

I wrote Fly Away for them.

Musically and lyrically, Fly Away is two songs I put together.
The first part, the "Fly away into the sea breeze" part was one of my first attempts to write a song that Jerry Garcia could sing.
I thought he would really like that "Footsteps in the sand wont be here tomorrow" bit.
I cannot remember where I learned the open chord shape I use in the song from, but I know that I was using it in a cover of Townes Van Zandt's For The Sake of The Song around the time I wrote Fly Away.

The second part is a love murder ballad sort of like Frankie & Johnny, or Deliah.
The twist is instead of the adulterer being murdered its instead the paramour.
I got the idea for the murderer from a true story I heard from some guys that grew up in Patterson.

They told me about this candy shop they used to hang out in as kids.
The owner would come in with a few women on his arm at all times, and go into the back.
They went back there with him one day and the guy had a velvet bed set up.
I remember thinking the resemblance to Big Jim from Bob Dylan's Lily Rosemary & The Jack Of Hearts.
I also had a few Basement Tapes ideas floating around: "When the seagulls cross over the town", "she gives it away for a song".

The rhythm for the verse has the same sort of shuffle that I used in Together.
For some reason this sort of laid back shuffle beat fits in my mind for the shore.

Performance wise, I remember struggling with this song at first.
I knew I wanted to play it at that festival, and I played it at open mic nights a lot.
It had a ton of kinks to get worked out.
It still does.

I always intended for all of the choruses to be played straight.
I start the first chorus straight, and the switch to the shuffled verse feels natural.
Switching back to the straight chorus after the verse is much more difficult, and always feels forced.
So, instead I leave it shuffled.
I find it more interesting like that anyway.
