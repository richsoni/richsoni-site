# Traditional Thought

The way I see it, there are two main hurdles of a typical adult life: Standing on your own feet, and earning enough to retire.
Standing on your feet is straight forward.
Most jobs in our economy provide this, or can be combined with another job to do this.
In my mind this is a requirement for success.

The earlier you do it, the better off you are.
Cut all financial ties.
It puts your life into perspective.
You are now an adult, and have accomplished your first feat.

Once this happens things get interesting.
The common track is to plan to retire by saving a little bit each paycheck for 40 years or so.
All the while getting promoted and raises proportional to your responsibility level for that age.
Increased wages are balanced by houses, kids, vacations, college etc.

This mindset limits your thinking.
Everything will always be driven by money.
It lends itself to conservatism and risk aversion.
By the time they retire, they are ready to settle down.

# Graduation

People retire when they no longer need to work to live.
Instead of retirement, I look at this as graduation.
People with a nest egg big enough to survive without working have a much different outlook than those that need to make money to eat.

These people have the freedom to explore the essence of them self.
This is why people say money does not buy happiness.
A terrible person with money is still a terrible person.
Yet, breaking through this boundary seems very compelling.

I have not graduated to this level yet, but am interested in the difference in thought it creates.
It certainly cannot be a bad thing to have enough wealth to live for the rest of your life with.
Additionally, it seems the younger a person attains this, the more time they have to explore the things they really love without any inhibitions.
