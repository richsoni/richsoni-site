to the train\\n-  I do whatever I want during that walk\\n  -  Sometimes I listen to an audiobook\\n  -  Other times I just listen to some music\\n- While walking and listening, I am open to letting my mind wander\\n- Sometimes new ideas occur, or old ideas bubble back to the surface\\n- When I need to write a blog post, I pay attention to the recurring ideas\\n- ...and, if I find an idea I like\\n   - I draft it on the train that morning\\n   - I try to get the whole idea out in that hour, unstructured\\n   - After that I revise the post many times\\n- Otherwise, I repeat this process until an idea comes up\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>When the brain is told to produce ideas, the subconscious will start to hunt for matches.\\nLike a search engine, it may take time to load, but it usually has the results you need.\\nIt returns mostly new versions and combinations of ideas it previously conceived.</p>\\n<h3>Dont Believe Me?</h3>\\n<p>If you are having trouble conjuring up ideas, then train your brain to get creative.\\nRead more about the science of harnessing your creative side in\\n<a

Thinking and Learning.</a>\\nThis book also presents practical methods for balancing your left and right brain.\\nWhen properly balanced it becomes an unstoppable force at formulating striking new

needs to be on <em>The Todo List</em>.</p>\\n<p>As an example, buying new sneakers may not need to make the list.\\nWhen you walk past a shoe store you will probably remember to buy some.\\nIf not, life will go on.\\nDon't burden yourself by putting those tasks on your todo list.</p>\\n<p>Bosses have sturdy expectations.\\nThey don't appreciate only some work being completed.\\nSometimes they
