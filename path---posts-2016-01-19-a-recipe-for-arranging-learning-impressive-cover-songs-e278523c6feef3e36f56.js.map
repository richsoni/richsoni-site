earlier.</p>\\n<h2>Find Your Chords / Strum Pattern</h2>\\n<p>This is a very important yet often neglected part.\\nFind the chords that sound the best.\\nJust because you found the key by moving the

to do it.</p>\\n<h2>Discover Your Delivery</h2>\\n<p>Now you know all the words, and the way you want to play the song.\\nFind words you want to savor, and practice their delivery.\\nYou are pretty much done.\\nAlthough a song is never learned, delivery can always improve.</p>\\n<h2>Record It For Future Reference</h2>\\n<p>Even if you do not play in releasing a recording or a video, make sure
