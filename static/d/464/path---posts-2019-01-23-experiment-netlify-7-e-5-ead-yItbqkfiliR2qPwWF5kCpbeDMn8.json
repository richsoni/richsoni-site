{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> is gaining popularity as an alternative to <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> for hosting static sites.\nOne of my first posts on this site, '[How I Use Github Pages to Host My Blog]' documented my experience using <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> to host my site.\nThat was back in 2013, and a lot has changed since then both on this site, and in technology offerings.</p>\n<p>In this post, I am going to work through launching a parallel build of my site on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>.\nThis will allow me to evaluate it as an alternative to hosting via Github pages.</p>\n<h1>Initial Deploy</h1>\n<p>I followed <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/\">A Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying on Netlify</a>, which got my site up with only one small hiccup:</p>\n<h2>Cannot Resolve Module</h2>\n<p>My first builds spit out this error:</p>\n<pre><code>9:52:49 PM:   Error: ./src/pages/posts.tsx\n9:52:49 PM:   Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../components/content/' in '/opt/build  /repo/src/pages'\n9:52:49 PM:   resolve '../components/content/' in '/opt/build/repo/src/pages'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Indeed my <code>posts.tsx</code> looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code>//./src/pages/posts.tsx\nimport Content from '../components/content/'\n</code></pre>\n<p>While the filesystem looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ls src/components/\nAlbumArtwork    FixedMenu       Logo            Table\nAlbumMediaCard  Footer          MailingListHalf Tabs\nBaseMeta        Half            MenuToggle      disqus\nBreadcrumbs     LatestRelease   OverlayMenu\nContent         Layout          ResponsiveMenu\nEventIndex      LocationMap.tsx SocialButton\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note the casing difference.  For some reason my machine allowed this casing mismatch, but Netlify did not.</p>\n<p>This issue took me a while to identify.  Here are some possible prevention tactics:\n[] Typescript: <a href=\"https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/file-name-casing/\">file-name-casing</a> rule would prevent, and automatically fix these issues in the future\n[] Using the <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/build-image\">netlify-build-image</a> to develop could have identified this issue more quickly</p>\n<h1>The Site</h1>\n<p>The site is located here: <a href=\"https://vigilant-wiles-695009.netlify.com/\">https://vigilant-wiles-695009.netlify.com/</a></p>\n<h1>Developing with the netlify-build-image</h1>\n<p>It seemed valuable to <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/build-image\">netlify-build-image</a> seemed to have a lot of benefits to me.  So, I decided to explore that option.</p>\n<p>This also was pretty simple.  I followed the <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/build-image#testing-locally\">Testing Locally</a> instructions, and they made sense, except for one confusing point:</p>\n<p><em>It was not clear that you had to clone the [netlify/build-image] repository</em>.</p>\n<p>I opened a Pull Request (<a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/build-image/pull/252\">https://github.com/netlify/build-image/pull/252</a>) with the tool to make the instructions more clear.\nHopefully they take the suggestions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Richsoni.com with Netlify","hero":null},"fields":{"date":"2019-01-23"}}},"pageContext":{"url":"/posts/2019-01-23-experiment-netlify/"}}
