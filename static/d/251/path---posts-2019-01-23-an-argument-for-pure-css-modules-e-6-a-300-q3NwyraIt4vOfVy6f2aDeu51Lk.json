Each approach compromises it for different reasons.  For example, inline styles are the top of the spectrum, so to override any inline style an <code>!important</code> is required</li>\n<li>States - <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, etc. are not supported in Inline Styles</li>\n<li>Custom Browser Optimizations and hooks - Using rules specific for browsers <code>-moz</code>, and GPU enabled transforms etc, are just not possible with inline styles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these only apply to InlineStyles.  Dynamically adding many <code>&#x3C;style></code> tags has a memory and CPU performance concern on the browser.\n<a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\">StyledComponents</a> also adds many extra <code>div</code> elements making the markup of the site messy, and increasing memory and CPU requirements of the site.</p>\n<p>Talia Marcassa makes a great point in <a href=\"https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21\">Styled Components: To Use or Not to Use?</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use Styled Components for elements whose styling (colours, images, etc.) is configured by the user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having used both CSSMoudles, Sass, and Inline Styles to implement a user definable style, I can definitely see how <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\">StyledComponents</a> is the right tool for that job.\nIn this use case I would consider using <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\">StyledComponents</a>, but in other cases, I simply feel that it is unnessisary.</p>\n<h3>üññSpeaking The Right Language</h3>\n<p>Besides the technical reasons I prefer using CSS, there is also a social driver as well.</p>\n<p>In essence, CSS is a language for describing <em>how</em> elements should be displayed by a browser.\nSince this is usually <em>negotiated between developers and designers</em> it seems logical to consider Conway's Law when making technical desisions about that relationship.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure ~ Melvin Conway (<a href=\"http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html\">Conway's Law</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this regard, Conway's Law suggests that the system design should consider the channel between design and engineering.</p>\n<p>While expecting a designer to grok inline JSX or <code>style</code> tag injection could be stretch, most designers can communication in CSS.</p>\n<p>For this reason alone, I am prone to prefer a CSS Solution.</p>\n<h3>Communication Channels When Creating Components:</h3>\n<img width='800' src='/images/posts/2019-01-23-speaking-dev.svg' />\n<h1>‚≠êOpinion 2: CSS Needs To Be Less Global</h1>\n<p>As Opinion 1 states, I believe styles usually belong in CSS.  However, I also believe that CSS is flawed.</p>\n<p>It is simple - CSS is global by default, and this causes namespace pollution and component coupling.</p>\n<p>CSSModules does one simple thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. ~ <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\">CSSModules</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does this by creating unique style names for each component:</p>\n<pre><code>/* ./src/Components/styles.module.css */\n.item {\n  background: blue;\n}\n\n// ./src/Component1/index.jsx\nimport styles from './styles.module.css'\nconsole.log(Object.keys) // ['.style-module--Component1-item-3TXyA']\n\n/* ./src/Component2/styles.module.css */\n.item {\n  background: black;\n}\n\n// ./src/Component2/index.jsx\nimport styles from './styles.module.css'\nconsole.log(Object.keys) // ['.style-module--Component2-item-0YYE1']\n</code></pre>\n<p>In many ways this makes CSSModules an automated version of a system like <a href=\"http://getbem.com/\">BEM</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Argument for Pure CSSModules","hero":null},"fields":{"date":"2019-01-23"}}},"pageContext":{"url":"/posts/2019-01-23-an-argument-for-pure-css-modules/"}}
