{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In the summer I converted my site from <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> to <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>.\nA few weeks later, the Gatsby team <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/\">announced the release of Gatsby v2</a>.<br>\nC'est la vie.</p>\n<p>After weeks of migrating data and code from Jekyll to Gatsby, I had no interest in doing an upgrade from Gatsby 1.9 to Gatsby 2.0.\nHowever, my interest was piqued this week, after a few murky attempts at installing <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-typescript/\">gatsby-plugin-typescript</a>.\nIt turns out that <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> is bundled by default in Gatsby V2, making <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-typescript/\">gatsby-plugin-typescript</a> unnecessary.\nThis was enough reason for me to perform the update.</p>\n<p>The update took a few hours, and was not that painful.\nAlthough some changes where required, and some issues where discovered.</p>\n<h1>The Upgrade Path</h1>\n<p>Listed on the <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/\">Gatsby V2 Announcement Page</a> was a link to a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#rename-boundactioncreators-to-actions\">migration guide</a> the team put together.\nI found  to be very helpful and informative.</p>\n<p>However, in all honesty, I followed my own upgrade strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade Gatsby</li>\n<li>Fix all Yarn errors and warnings</li>\n<li>Run <code>gatsby develop</code></li>\n<li>Fix all <code>gatsby develop</code> errors and warnings</li>\n<li>Load the site</li>\n<li>Fix all visual errors</li>\n<li>Go through (the Gatsby upgrade guide)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#rename-boundactioncreators-to-actions] to make sure I did not miss anything</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There where some hiccups along the way, but I was able to complete the upgrade in about 3 hours.</p>\n<h1>Upgrade</h1>\n<p>I could not figure out how to upgrade my yarn packages.\nFirst I tried this:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn upgrade-interactive\n</code></pre>\n<p>I selected Gatsby, but it did not upgrade to v2 since the version was '1.9.277'.\nAfter some Googling, I tried:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn upgrade gatsby --latest\n</code></pre>\n<p>This did the trick.</p>\n<p>Then I got brave and ran:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn upgrade --latest\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which successfully ran, but it spit out a bunch of warnings.\nI used <code>yarn outdated</code> and <code>yarn check</code> to figure out which packages where actually broken.</p>\n<p>This is when I ran into my first issue.</p>\n<h2>gatsby-pathdata outdated</h2>\n<p>Its a developers worst nightmare: You are new to a framework, and need to do something weird.\nYou find only one plugin that does what you want, and its not maintained, but you are not knowledgable yet to write your own.\nYou reluctantly add it, hoping that there are no issues.</p>\n<p>Then voila! you get something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>error \"gatsby-plugin-pathdata#gatsby@1.x\" doesn't satisfy found match of \"gatsby@2.0.59\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>I decided to ignore it, and see if I could survive.\nIt turns out I could.\nSo, at the end of the migration I created an issue on github and continued on with my life: <a href=\"https://github.com/barskern/gatsby-plugin-pathdata/issues/1\">https://github.com/barskern/gatsby-plugin-pathdata/issues/1</a> </p>\n<p>Here are the changes I made to my package.json:</p>\n<pre><code>diff package.json\n-  \"gatsby\": \"^1.9.277\",\n-  \"gatsby-link\": \"^1.6.46\",\n+  \"gatsby\": \"^2.0.0\",\n+  \"gatsby-link\": \"^2.0.7\",\n\n-  \"gatsby-plugin-react-helmet\": \"^2.0.11\",\n-  \"gatsby-plugin-typography\": \"^1.7.19\",\n-  \"gatsby-source-filesystem\": \"^1.5.39\",\n-  \"gatsby-transformer-remark\": \"^1.7.44\",\n-  \"gatsby-transformer-yaml\": \"^1.5.18\",\n+  \"gatsby-plugin-react-helmet\": \"^3.0.3\",\n+  \"gatsby-source-filesystem\": \"^2.0.10\",\n+  \"gatsby-transformer-remark\": \"^2.1.14\",\n+  \"gatsby-transformer-yaml\": \"^2.1.6\",\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Gatsby Develop</h1>\n<p>The next thing I did was run <code>gatsby develop</code>.\nI was hoping for no errors, but instead I saw a ton.</p>\n<h2>React</h2>\n<p>The first error I saw was this:</p>\n<pre><code>This dependency was not found:\n\n* react in ./src/pages/index.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the first time I went back to (the Gatsby upgrade guide)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#rename-boundactioncreators-to-actions]\nThey have instructions <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#manually-install-react\">here</a> which state:</p>\n<p><em>In v1, the react and react-dom packages were included as part of the gatsby package. They are now peerDependencies so you are required to install them into your project.</em></p>\n<p><code>npm i react react-dom</code></p>\n<p>I added them, and the error went away.</p>\n<h1>Upgrade Packages</h1>\n<pre><code>diff package.json\n+  \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\",\n+  \"react\": \"^16.6.3\",\n+  \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\",\n</code></pre>\n<h2>ESLint</h2>\n<p>Next I saw errors from ESLint:</p>\n<pre><code>Warning: React version not specified in eslint-plugin-react settings. See https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#configuration.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I did not have ESLint in my project, so I was confused.\nI searched quite a bit, and could find nowhere stating the ESlint was now required.\nHowever, I simply followed the link from the error after that, and added this file that repo suggested:</p>\n<pre><code>diff .eslintrc\n+  {\n+    \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"plugin:react/recommended\"]\n+  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The ESlint errors went away!</p>\n<h1>Import GraphQL</h1>\n<p>Next I saw many warnings like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>warning Using the global `graphql` tag is deprecated, and will not be supported in v3.\nImport it instead like:  import { graphql } from 'gatsby' in file:\n</code></pre>\n<p>I did ran a quick vim macro to update all of these:</p>\n<pre><code>vim `git jump grep graphql`\nVIM MACRO: qq}Oimport {graphql} from 'graphql'\u0003:w\n:argnext\nq\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#import-graphql-from-gatsby\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#import-graphql-from-gatsby</a></p>\n<h1>BoundActionCreators</h1>\n<p>There was only one more error:</p>\n<pre><code>boundActionCreators is deprecated. Please use actions instead. For migration instructions, see https://gatsby.app/boundActionCreators\nCheck the following files:\n\narchive/2018-08-04/bundle.js\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#rename-boundactioncreators-to-actions\">The docs</a> outline the change that needs to be made.\nHowever, I still saw the error after I changed boundActionCreators to just <code>actions</code>.</p>\n<p>I realized the file was not part of my Gatsby project.</p>\n<p>After some poking around I concluded this was a bug in Gatsby itself.</p>\n<p>While my file was not being imported by Webpack, Gatsby was still scanning it for boundActionCreators.</p>\n<p>I opened an issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/10211\">https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/10211</a></p>\n<p>This issue was not breaking my build, so I went to Chrome, and looked at my page.</p>\n<h1>Visit Page</h1>\n<p>The only major visual issue, was my navigation was missing.\nI remembered reading a section about this in the upgrade guide.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#import-graphql-from-gatsby\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#import-graphql-from-gatsby</a></p>\n<p>Had to do this in two places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home Page index had to import Layout</li>\n<li>I already had a ContentPage Layout, so I just imported the base Layout there</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Go through guide</h1>\n<p>After that, I read through the guide, and made only 1 other commit to remove explicit query names because I don't like them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#explicit-query-names-no-longer-required\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#explicit-query-names-no-longer-required</a></p>\n<pre><code>export const query = graphql`\n-  query ThisIsExplicitQueryName($slug: String!) {\n+  query($slug: String!) {\n    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\n      html\n      frontmatter {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Upgrading richsoni.com To Gatsby 2","hero":"/images/posts/gatsby-logo.jpg"},"fields":{"date":"2018-11-29"}}},"pageContext":{"url":"/posts/2018-11-29-gatsby-2-upgrade/"}}
