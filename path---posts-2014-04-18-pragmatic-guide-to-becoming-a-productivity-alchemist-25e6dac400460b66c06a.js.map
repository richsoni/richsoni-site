become visible / engaged with.</p>\\n<p>Zen Mode, also known as distraction free mode, stretches a single window across the entirety of a computer screen's real estate.\\nZen Mode typically removes

Done</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here is a list of Guidelines for combining the four elements of TOPZ together.\\nThe result is not a <em>Zero Sum Game</em>, meaning the combination of these elements creates a stronger effect than each do on their own.\\nCherry-picking elements that are easy to integrate into your current workflow is not as effective as adapting the workflow to fully integrate TOPZ.</p>\\n<p>These rules are the [Minimum Effective Dose](<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective<em>dose</em>(pharmacology</a>) for monstrous productivity gains.</p>\\n<h2>Easy Access To Todo.txt</h2>\\n<p>Todo.txt needs to be accessible at all times while working.\\nDuring Pomodoros, use it to jot down digressions that should be considered later (possibly on break).\\nThis will relieve your memory of that thought, and bring focus back to the current task.\\nThe faster this is completed the better, so enable Todo.txt to be just a keystroke away.\\nDipping into Todo.txt should barely waiver your concentration.</p>\\n<p><em>Warning</em>: switching to Todo.txt should not induce further distraction e.g. having YouTube opened next to the window with your Todo.txt.</p>\\n<h2>Manage Pomodoro In Todo.txt</h2>\\n<p>It makes sense to manage Pomodoro with Todo.txt since <a href=\\\"#EasyAccessToTodotxt\\\">rule #1</a> advises that it should always be one keystroke away.\\nUsing a separate application is overkill, and adds too many variables to the process.\\nFollow these tips to adapt Todo.txt to support the handful of functionality that Pomodoro requires.</p>\\n<p>Begin all non-todo-item lines with a comment symbol (the <code>#</code>).\\nThis denotes that the line ignores the Todo.txt rules.\\nAs such, it is an easy way to augment Todo.txt in a sane way.</p>\\n<p>Log Pomodoros (in groups of four) as they are completed, and interuppted:</p>\\n<pre><code> #completed   XXXX XX\\n #interrupted XX\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Geek Tip:</em> These tallies can be put into a daily log at the end of the day, so they can be analyzed if desired.</p>\\n<p>Keep a section where the next few Pomodoros get fleshed out:</p>\\n<pre><code> #POM\\n (A)  get order show form working with child serialize\\n (B)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\\n (B)  Residental Checkbox\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Quickly revise this plan at the beginning of each break to ensure its accuracy.\\nThis section helps manage expectation with stakeholders by having an up to date estimate of how long a task will take.</p>\\n<p>Tasks get placed in the <code>#inbox</code> when concieved during a Pomodoro.\\nThey will be categorized and prioritized at a later time, and then placed into the <code>#backlog</code> section.\\nThe tasks planned for the current day go into the <code>#today</code> section.</p>\\n<pre><code> #inbox\\n Dentist Appointment\\n A B testing\\n carbonseats.com\\n\\n #today\\n (A) Finish up testing\\n\\n #backlog\\n (A) +HOME Paperwork\\n (A) +HOME Fold Laundry\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Every Pomodoro Has A Goal</h2>\\n<pre><code> #POM\\n (A)  get order show form working with child serialize\\n (B)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\\n (B)  Residental Checkbox\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Each Pomodoro has a distinct goal.\\nTasks need to be broken into bite sized chunks that can be completed during 1 Pomodoro.\\n<strong>This is super important.</strong>\\nIt cuts the cruft out of task completion because getting off track will only diverge the current Pomodoro.\\nBy revising the plan during the break, the big picture is continually brought back into perspective.</p>\\n<h2>Don't Break Pomodoros At All Costs</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p> The Atomic Unit of time is a Pomodoro.  A Pomodoro is Indivisible\\n~ Francesco Cirillo (Inventor of Pomodoro)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><em>Pomodoros should never be paused, and never be stopped.</em>\\nIf the Pomodoro is interrupted then a fresh one needs to be started.\\nFinishing early means there is time to reprioritize the task list, or to start on the next task.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"#OffCycleWork\\\">Off Cycle Work</a> is the easiest way to sidestep external distraction.\\nHowever, during regular work hours Pomodoro should still be used.\\nIf a distraction arises, try saying \\\"I am currently busy, can I sync up with you in 15 (or whenever the Pomodoro is done)?\\\"\\nPlanned distraction is fine, Pomodoro promotes long breaks in which any activity can be done.\\nHowever, the work time is sacred and should be treated respectfully.</p>\\n<p><em>Note:</em> There are always exceptions to this rule, please use your own discretion when telling superiors to wait.</p>\\n<h2>Schedule Distraction Activities</h2>\\n<p>As stated above, planned distraction is a healthy part of being productive.\\nThis is true as long as it is planned, and does not interfere with actual work.\\nChecking Twitter, chatting by the coffee machine, or even personal chores need to get done.\\nIf they are suppressed then the ability to focus on work will be suboptimal.</p>\\n<p>By planning a Pomodoro to have a meeting, or to read reddit helps control the distraction.\\nWhen the distraction Pomodoro or break is over, its time to get back to work.\\nThere is always the next break to continue with this activity.</p>\\n<h2>Don't Leave Zen Mode Until Work Is Done</h2>\\n<p>Stay in Zen Mode as often as possible.\\nThis is true even for email applications, and web browsing.\\nFocusing on one thing at a time will yield the highest quality results at the quickest speed.\\nThis is true even for chatting a friend up on LinkedIn.</p>\\n<p>Avoid non Zen Mode Applications as much as possible as they will derail the goal of the Pomodoro.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p>In summary, managing distraction is the key to being ultra productive.\\nTo wrangle distraction, both internal and external interruptions must be eschewed.\\nThe TOPZ method is a foundation for creating a workflow which avoids distraction.\\nIt is regimented yet simplistic.\\nBy following some guidelines TOPZ provide a structure which enables you to be super productive.\\nTOPZ is designed to be learned, and get out of the way.</p>\\n<h1>Resources</h1>\\n<p><em>I only recommend products I use and endorse.\\nIf you choose to take my recommendations please use the following links, so I can recieve affiliate credit.\\nIf I do not have affiliate links to your favorite site, please let me know so I can use them in the future.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://todotxt.com/\\\">Official Website</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format\\\">Todo.txt Formatting Rules</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\">The Official Todo.txt iPhone App</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-nearest-starbucks/id446983581?mt=8&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\">Find Nearest Starbucks</a> App</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&#x26;uo=4\\\">PomodoroApp</a> <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\" style=\\\"display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.png) no-repeat;width:81px;height:15px;@media only screen{background-image:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.svg);}\\\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3981567900/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3981567900&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=JDSVLCXRUREJC6GR\\\">The Official Pomodoro Book</a><img src=\\\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=3981567900\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"border:none !important;

become visible / engaged with.</p>\\n<p>Zen Mode, also known as distraction free mode, stretches a single window across the entirety of a computer screen's real estate.\\nZen Mode typically removes any extra cruft and chrome from the application to minimize distraction e.g. menus, toolbars, notifications.\\nMost applications provide a simple <em>Poor Man's Zen Mode</em> i.e. fullscreen, for

Done</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here is a list of Guidelines for combining the four elements of TOPZ together.\\nThe result is not a <em>Zero Sum Game</em>, meaning the combination of these elements creates a stronger effect than each do on their own.\\nCherry-picking elements that are easy to integrate into your current workflow is not as effective as adapting the workflow to fully integrate TOPZ.</p>\\n<p>These rules are the [Minimum Effective Dose](<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective<em>dose</em>(pharmacology</a>) for monstrous productivity gains.</p>\\n<h2>Easy Access To Todo.txt</h2>\\n<p>Todo.txt needs to be accessible at all times while working.\\nDuring Pomodoros, use it to jot down digressions that should be considered later (possibly on break).\\nThis will relieve your memory of that thought, and bring focus back to the current task.\\nThe faster this is completed the better, so enable Todo.txt to be just a keystroke away.\\nDipping into Todo.txt should barely waiver your concentration.</p>\\n<p><em>Warning</em>: switching to Todo.txt should not induce further distraction e.g. having YouTube opened next to the window with your Todo.txt.</p>\\n<h2>Manage Pomodoro In Todo.txt</h2>\\n<p>It makes sense to manage Pomodoro with Todo.txt since <a href=\\\"#EasyAccessToTodotxt\\\">rule #1</a> advises that it should always be one keystroke away.\\nUsing a separate application is overkill, and adds too many variables to the process.\\nFollow these tips to adapt Todo.txt to support the handful of functionality that Pomodoro requires.</p>\\n<p>Begin all non-todo-item lines with a comment symbol (the <code>#</code>).\\nThis denotes that the line ignores the Todo.txt rules.\\nAs such, it is an easy way to augment Todo.txt in a sane way.</p>\\n<p>Log Pomodoros (in groups of four) as they are completed, and interuppted:</p>\\n<pre><code> #completed   XXXX XX\\n #interrupted XX\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Geek Tip:</em> These tallies can be put into a daily log at the end of the day, so they can be analyzed if desired.</p>\\n<p>Keep a section where the next few Pomodoros get fleshed out:</p>\\n<pre><code> #POM\\n (A)  get order show form working with child serialize\\n (B)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\\n (B)  Residental Checkbox\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Quickly revise this plan at the beginning of each break to ensure its accuracy.\\nThis section helps manage expectation with stakeholders by having an up to date estimate of how long a task will take.</p>\\n<p>Tasks get placed in the <code>#inbox</code> when concieved during a Pomodoro.\\nThey will be categorized and prioritized at a later time, and then placed into the <code>#backlog</code> section.\\nThe tasks planned for the current day go into the <code>#today</code> section.</p>\\n<pre><code> #inbox\\n Dentist Appointment\\n A B testing\\n carbonseats.com\\n\\n #today\\n (A) Finish up testing\\n\\n #backlog\\n (A) +HOME Paperwork\\n (A) +HOME Fold Laundry\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Every Pomodoro Has A Goal</h2>\\n<pre><code> #POM\\n (A)  get order show form working with child serialize\\n (B)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\\n (B)  Residental Checkbox\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Each Pomodoro has a distinct goal.\\nTasks need to be broken into bite sized chunks that can be completed during 1 Pomodoro.\\n<strong>This is super important.</strong>\\nIt cuts the cruft out of task completion because getting off track will only diverge the current Pomodoro.\\nBy revising the plan during the break, the big picture is continually brought back into perspective.</p>\\n<h2>Don't Break Pomodoros At All Costs</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p> The Atomic Unit of time is a Pomodoro.  A Pomodoro is Indivisible\\n~ Francesco Cirillo (Inventor of Pomodoro)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><em>Pomodoros should never be paused, and never be stopped.</em>\\nIf the Pomodoro is interrupted then a fresh one needs to be started.\\nFinishing early means there is time to reprioritize the task list, or to start on the next task.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"#OffCycleWork\\\">Off Cycle Work</a> is the easiest way to sidestep external distraction.\\nHowever, during regular work hours Pomodoro should still be used.\\nIf a distraction arises, try saying \\\"I am currently busy, can I sync up with you in 15 (or whenever the Pomodoro is done)?\\\"\\nPlanned distraction is fine, Pomodoro promotes long breaks in which any activity can be done.\\nHowever, the work time is sacred and should be treated respectfully.</p>\\n<p><em>Note:</em> There are always exceptions to this rule, please use your own discretion when telling superiors to wait.</p>\\n<h2>Schedule Distraction Activities</h2>\\n<p>As stated above, planned distraction is a healthy part of being productive.\\nThis is true as long as it is planned, and does not interfere with actual work.\\nChecking Twitter, chatting by the coffee machine, or even personal chores need to get done.\\nIf they are suppressed then the ability to focus on work will be suboptimal.</p>\\n<p>By planning a Pomodoro to have a meeting, or to read reddit helps control the distraction.\\nWhen the distraction Pomodoro or break is over, its time to get back to work.\\nThere is always the next break to continue with this activity.</p>\\n<h2>Don't Leave Zen Mode Until Work Is Done</h2>\\n<p>Stay in Zen Mode as often as possible.\\nThis is true even for email applications, and web browsing.\\nFocusing on one thing at a time will yield the highest quality results at the quickest speed.\\nThis is true even for chatting a friend up on LinkedIn.</p>\\n<p>Avoid non Zen Mode Applications as much as possible as they will derail the goal of the Pomodoro.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p>In summary, managing distraction is the key to being ultra productive.\\nTo wrangle distraction, both internal and external interruptions must be eschewed.\\nThe TOPZ method is a foundation for creating a workflow which avoids distraction.\\nIt is regimented yet simplistic.\\nBy following some guidelines TOPZ provide a structure which enables you to be super productive.\\nTOPZ is designed to be learned, and get out of the way.</p>\\n<h1>Resources</h1>\\n<p><em>I only recommend products I use and endorse.\\nIf you choose to take my recommendations please use the following links, so I can recieve affiliate credit.\\nIf I do not have affiliate links to your favorite site, please let me know so I can use them in the future.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://todotxt.com/\\\">Official Website</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format\\\">Todo.txt Formatting Rules</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\">The Official Todo.txt iPhone App</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-nearest-starbucks/id446983581?mt=8&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\">Find Nearest Starbucks</a> App</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&#x26;uo=4\\\">PomodoroApp</a> <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&uo=4\\\" target=\\\"itunes_store\\\" style=\\\"display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.png) no-repeat;width:81px;height:15px;@media only screen{background-image:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.svg);}\\\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3981567900/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3981567900&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=JDSVLCXRUREJC6GR\\\">The Official Pomodoro Book</a><img src=\\\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=3981567900\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"border:none !important;
