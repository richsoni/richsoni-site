Johnny", or "Delia".</p>\n<p>I remember this song was difficult to perform at first.\nThis was because of the time signature changes.\nIt felt awkward to switch back from 12/8 to a 4/4 for the chorus.\nAfter a while, I gave up on the switch and left it as 12/8 after the first chorus.</p>\n<p>I performed the song when I played at the festival, and was surprised at how well it sounded in the recordings.\nBecause of this it earned a regular spot in my setlist.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Fly Away",hero:null},fields:{date:"2017-08-30"}}},pathContext:{url:"/posts/2017-08-30-fly-away/"}}}});
