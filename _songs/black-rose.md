First time I saw her, was down in New Orleans  
Steeping a cure-all, of honey and Jimson weed  
She sewed a mojo hand in the seam of my jean  
Did a little dance like a voodoo queen  

Ohhh ohh black rose  
Never near, but always close  
Face to face when the moonlight glows  
Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes  
Oooh black rose  

Saw her gathering feathers, outside of Stovepipe Wells  
Wearing some leather, plated with terrapin shells  
Pricked my hand, pulled me under her spell  
In the cool of the sand heard the spirits yell  

Ohhh ohh black rose  
Never near, but always close  
Face to face when the moonlight glows  
Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes  
Oooh black rose  

The last time I saw her was in the lake eerie fog  
Eyes in the water, i thought she was just a mirage  
Sitting low in the wake of the bog  
Emerging slow, floating like a god  

Ohhh ohh black rose  
Never near, but always close  
Face to face when the moonlight glows  
Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes  
Oooh black rose
