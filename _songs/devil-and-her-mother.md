title: Devil & Her Mother
---

The devil and her mother  
Rained it down on me  
When I mentioned that her lover  
Was seen kissing Nelly B  

The devil and her mother  
They raced across the room  
Pushed aside poor Nelly  
And sent johnny to his tomb  

Mama this man,  
He was doin' me wrong  

The devil and her mother  
They never tell no jokes  
And, if you tell one to them  
Your get your ankles broked  

The devil and her mother  
They like to tell their lies  
But, if you tell em yours  
They'll scratch you in the eyes  

Mama this man,  
He was doin' me wrong  

The devil's icy father  
Came rising from the sea  
Saying whats become of Johnny?  
Well, he laid with Nelly B.  

Papa this man,  
He was doin' me wrong  

The devil and her mother  
To pay for what they've done  
Where banished past the river  
To the land where there is no sun  

If you ride that river  
With a full moon in the sky  
You can her the devil whisper  
Dear is that your guy  

Mama that man,  
He was doin' me wrong
