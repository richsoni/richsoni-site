They say to stay away
From the house by the mouth of the walnut lagoon
All of the town gossip about
The girl when laughs at the moon

Sister June is drunk in her room
In The Governor Seat is a leech
Wearing buffalo skin
The farmer skipped town
But his kids float around
And Alas,
The girl who laughs at the moon

<Cm>When the light</Cm> <A#>hides</A#>
<G#7>The stars in the</G#7> <G>sky</G>
<Cm>Its easy to</Cm> <A#>loose yourself in a</A#> <G#7>dream you think is</G#7> <A#>true</A#>
<Cm>So when its burning</Cm> <A#>out</A#>
<G#7>You either lower your</G#7> <C#dim>snout</C#dim>
<F7>Or you lookup<F7>, <A#7>and you laugh at</A#7> <D#>the moon</D#>

On a warm eve
I start to believe
This Old World
Got not time to whistle my tune
So, I chastise the town
And they call me a clown
Like the girl who laughs at the moon
